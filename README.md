# Coffee Ghost
This is the game dev repo for our coffee ghost delivery game! 
# Summary 

This game consists of Co-op play where players are ghosts that have the ability to pass through walls and certain objects to deliver coffee. The players are ghost baristas in a coffee shop where appliances will spontaneously break and the only way to fix them is by haunting. Customer NPCs will come in and demand their coffee and players must fulfil the orders within a certain time limit to complete that level. Players can speed up by passing through walls but the coffee can't come with them. The theme is a chill cooking game with a new spooky mechanic.

## Ideas 

## Brainstorming
### Inspirations
  * Overcooked, Cooking Mama
### Basic Mechanics
  *Player can go through walls, Coffee can't
  * Co-op?
  * Cook times
    * Pour-over, French Press, Espresso, Aero-press
    * Prep work
      * Milk prep, bakery, Bean prep
  * Kitchen Layout map
    * Obstacles
    * 3-D vs isometric
    * Low-Poly, Coffee Aesthetic
    * Simple textures
    
  * Possess Appliances
    * Appliances break, must haunt to fix. Haunting takes time
    
  * External
    * Hide from ghost checking health inspectors
    * Clean-up ectoplasm to keep machines going
  * Upgrades for the shop
    * Management vs Different environments
    * Shop extensions and menu extensions (Ghost Parfaits, poetry riffoff)
    * Ghost evolution (Faster Ghost meter repair, ectoplasm babies)

### 10/28
  * Co-op
    * Green and blue ghost either cook or deliver. The delivery ghost is the only one that can possess and fix the machines. The cooking ghost can only control temperature, boil roasts to a specific temperature and keep the freezer/fridge. 
      * pasteries are a stretch goal.
    * Island between kitchen and service area so the ghost has to set the coffee down before the other one can pick it back up/ walk through the wall.
    * Delivery ghost - take orders, clean tables, deliver orders, fix machines, can't walk through tables otherwise spills coffee / throw tables.
    * Cooking ghost - Control temperature of freezer and boiler, roasts beans, makes milk, construct coffee, make pastries?(possibe third player).
  * DO NOT want washing dishes!!!(fourth player rotate joystick to wash dishes)
  * Want more chill than overcooked
    * Keep x number of customers happy. Bonus in time limit?
    
### 10/30
 * would the characters be able to bump into eachother in the ghosting phase? i.e being able to pass through a solid character if one was in a transparent phase, but if both are in transparent phase they will bump into eachother. 
 * haunting function - long press, when pressed ghost haunts -> a repair meter will appear and will go down after a certain time of haunting 
 *CONTROLLER: probably a a controller not keyboard, too many functions for keyboard - might get crowded
