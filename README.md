# Coffee Ghost
This is the game dev repo for our coffee ghost delivery game! 
# Summary 

This game consists of Co-op play where players are ghosts that have the ability to pass through walls and certain objects to deliver coffee. The players are ghost baristas in a coffee shop where appliances will spontaneously break and the only way to fix them is by haunting. Customer NPCs will come in and demand their coffee and players must fulfil the orders within a certain time limit to complete that level. Players can speed up by passing through walls but the coffee can't come with them. The theme is a chill cooking game with a new spooky mechanic.
