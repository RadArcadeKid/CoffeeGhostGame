## Ideas 

## Brainstorming
### Inspirations
  * Overcooked, Cooking Mama
### Basic Mechanics
  *Player can go through walls, Coffee can't
  * Co-op?
  * Cook times
    * Pour-over, French Press, Espresso, Aero-press
    * Prep work
      * Milk prep, bakery, Bean prep
  * Kitchen Layout map
    * Obstacles
    * 3-D vs isometric
    * Low-Poly, Coffee Aesthetic
    * Simple textures
    
  * Possess Appliances
    * Appliances break, must haunt to fix. Haunting takes time
    
  * External
    * Hide from ghost checking health inspectors
    * Clean-up ectoplasm to keep machines going
  * Upgrades for the shop
    * Management vs Different environments
    * Shop extensions and menu extensions (Ghost Parfaits, poetry riffoff)
    * Ghost evolution (Faster Ghost meter repair, ectoplasm babies)

### 10/28
  * Co-op
    * Green and blue ghost either cook or deliver. The delivery ghost is the only one that can possess and fix the machines. The cooking ghost can only control temperature, boil roasts to a specific temperature and keep the freezer/fridge. 
      * pasteries are a stretch goal.
    * Island between kitchen and service area so the ghost has to set the coffee down before the other one can pick it back up/ walk through the wall.
    * Delivery ghost - take orders, clean tables, deliver orders, fix machines, can't walk through tables otherwise spills coffee / throw tables.
    * Cooking ghost - Control temperature of freezer and boiler, roasts beans, makes milk, construct coffee, make pastries?(possibe third player).
  * DO NOT want washing dishes!!!(fourth player rotate joystick to wash dishes)
  * Want more chill than overcooked
    * Keep x number of customers happy. Bonus in time limit?
    
### 10/30
 * would the characters be able to bump into eachother in the ghosting phase? i.e being able to pass through a solid character if one was in a transparent phase, but if both are in transparent phase they will bump into eachother. 
 * haunting function - long press, when pressed ghost haunts -> a repair meter will appear and will go down after a certain time of haunting 
 *CONTROLLER: probably a a controller not keyboard, too many functions for keyboard - might get crowded
 * the game has to be appropriately hard so that we can make sure that the players spill coffee every once in a while.

 ###CORE MECHANICS 
##Core Values: 
 *Chaos 
 *Chill Coffee shop atmosphere
 *Co-op
##Core Mechanics: 
 *Going through walls
   *Player can pass through walls/tables but the coffee they must deliver cannot
   *They must go back and get another cup if they spill one
*Possessing appliances
   *Machines break and players must possess them(long button press?) to repair them
*Time management
  *Players must multitask and strategize to keep as many customers as happy as possible. Customers have a meter that  determines *how long before they become angry
*Multistep recipes
  *Players have to move from station to station in order to produce the coffee(think overcooked)
